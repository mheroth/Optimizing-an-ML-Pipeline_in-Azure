# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data about individuals who are applying for bank loans. We seek to predict wheter each individualer will subscribe to a service or not. Therefore we use the based information about each individual."

The best performing model was a the voting ensemble with ...% accuracy. There were also a lot of other models with a comparable accuracy."

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
The Scikit-learn pipeline uses the provided data from the given URL as input. After download a cleaning function is used to to the folllowing steps:
- Removing NaNs from the dataset
- One-hot encoding job titles, contact and education variables
- Encoding a additional categorical vales
- Enconding months of the year
- Encoding the target variable.

After cleaning the data is split into train and test dataset. A 
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
